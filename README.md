## About

mkdocs-deploy began as a drop-in replacement for [mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike).  The main goal is to provide
a deployment tool that is version aware and plugable, capable of deploying multiple versions side by side to any target
website.

## Author

Mkdocs-deploy was developed by Philip Couling while working at [Habitat Energy](https://www.habitat.energy/)
